- ⚡ Fun fact: The term "debugging" in programming originated from an actual insect! In 1947, Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found an actual moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She removed the bug and documented it as the first case of debugging a computer. Since then, "debugging" has been the term used for fixing errors in software.
